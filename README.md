# Smart-Medicine-Box
An embedded system course project


In day-to-day life most of the people need to take medicines which was not the case in past couple of years and the reason behind this, is that the spread of diseases is increasing. So sooner or later many people will come into contact with these diseases. Some diseases are temporary diseases while many are permanent life-threatening diseases. Life span of humans decreases because of such diseases and to overcome or to live a better life we need to take medicines regularly. We need to take the advice of the doctor who tells us to take desired pills in desired way so that patients who face problems like forgetting pills to take at right time and also when Doctor changes the prescription of medicine patients have to remember the new schedule of medicine. This problem of forgetting to take pills at right time, taking wrong medicines and accidentally taking expired medicines cause health issues. Our project is Arduino-Mega based Smart medicine box which uses Real time clock. It is compulsory for the patient to take pills from the box at the right time otherwise our system continues to make sound until the medicine is taken out from the box. This notification feature adds life years to the patient and thus this thing is not available in any device which is a necessity at present day.
